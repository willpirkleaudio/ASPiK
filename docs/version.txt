#define ASPiK_VERSION_BUILD  0

Release Notes 1.9.0:
* VSTGUI4: updated to 4.12, required for all new projects
* VST3: updated to SDK 3.7.7
        added support for VSTGUI 4.12
* AU: updated to new SDK 1.1.0 (required)
* AAX: updated and now supports v2.3.2, v2.4.0 and v2.4.1
* MacOS: Apple Silicon support (select in Xcode)

Release Notes 1.7.2:
* Fixed save to XML file issues caused by new VSTGUI4 library

Release Notes 1.7.0 & 1.7.1:
* Fixed bug with VSTGUI4 init/exit library functions; these needed to be replicated
  or moved for the other APIs, AU and AAX; tightened code a bit with less API defines
  required
* Fixed missing global extern in VST3's factory.cpp file 

Release Notes 1.6.9:
* Fixed issue with sidechain inputs in VST3, this affected only the vst3plugin.cpp file; 
  all others including the plugin kernel were not changed and are fine

Release Notes 1.6.8:
* Updated to latest VSTGUI 4.10 -- NOTE: Steinberg made numerous changes to this version
  I suggest creating a new "myprojects2" folder for the current version 
* VST3: added MIDI proxy parameters for synths
        fixed and streamlined the factory preset mechanism and IUnitInfo
        added support for VSTGUI 4.10
* AU: added support for VSTGUI 4.10
* AAX: added support for VSTGUI 4.10
* Added support and custom code for audio processing:
  NOTE: this functionality was *always* available, but you had to write your own code
        You can now set this up in the ASPiKreator (or in code) and it is easy to change
        later if you want. 
  - Frames: the default, newbie approved audio processing mechanism
  - Buffers: process entire buffers directly on the DAW I/O arrays 
  - Sub-block: process sub-blocks of the buffers (break the buffer into smaller pieces)
               this also processes the DAW arrays directly (no audio copying)
* Added two new CustomViews: 
  - CustomTextLabel: dynamically changeable label with left/center/right horiz align
  - CustomOptionMenu: dynamically changeable option menu, allows you to change the 
    contents of the menu (but not the number of items, which would ruin automation)
* Streamlined the parameter smoothing processing for more efficient CPU usage
* Separated VST3 Sample Accurate Automation out from param smoothing loop allowing
  you to easily turn this on or off (most users don't use it)
* ASPiKreator: changed both MacOS and Windows to full installers with support folders, codesigned MacOS 
* Documentation: re-worked portions for better readability and added block/buffer processing materials

Release Notes 1.6.7:
* VST3: tightened up log/antilog conversion code
* AU: fixed bug when Reaper closes the AU without first closing the GUI window
* Fixed "-inf" error with Log controls
* Fixed annoyance where default values are slightly off for text readouts (but OK internally)
  For example, the GUI shows 2799.999 when the default value is 2800.0
* PluginGUI: fixed crash when typing non-numeric data into numeric box
* PluginGUI: changed validation code to snap to min or max when user enters values out of bounds rather than retaining old value
* ASPiKreator: changed Windows implementation, added diagnostics report


Release Notes 1.6.6:
* VST3: Updated to VST SDK 3.7.1
* VST3: changed plugin resize code to accomodate all known hosts
* AAX: fixed <CTRL>-S annoyance where session is saved, but Pro Tools shows project as dirty
* Plugin Kernel: optimized outer parameter smoothing function for minimal CPU overhead
* Custom Views: added dynamic combo boxes (drop-list controls)
* Custom Views: added dynamic text labels
* ASPiKreator: bullet-proofed the data brick used for new project creation
* ASPiKreator: added option for user to customize new project with additional files, etc.
* ASPiKreator: added option to restore data brick in case user accidentally corrupts it while customizing
- VSTGUI4: v4.9 (no change, following  VSTDSDK releases)
- RAFX2: added status window messages; easily modified for other RAFX2 hosts, no affect on ASPiK

* VST3: fixed minor 32 byte/control memory leak for GUIs (VST3 only)
* Custom Views: fixed minor 190 byte memory leak in SpectrumView
* Custom View Demos: fixed "memory creep" issue with lock free ring buffer on plugin side (not a true memory leak)

* VST3: new SDK changed name of a core file, so changed accordingly

* ALL APIs: added the PRODUCT_BUNDLE_ID... to CMake to eliminate warnings that were confusing (benign, but confusing when debugging)
- rebuilt ASPiKreator for MacOS (Win did not require rebuild)
